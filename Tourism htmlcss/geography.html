            Today, 12 ski resorts operate in Iran, but the most famous are Tochal, Dizin, and Shemshak, all within one to three hours of Tehran. In some glaciers and year-round snow fields near Tehran, skiing began in 1938, thanks to the efforts of two German railway engineers.
    
            Tochal skiing resort
            See also: Tehran#Parks and recreation
            One of the best ski resorts around the world. Tochal 7th station has skiing eight months of the year.
    
            The French (Poma) built gondolas that carry tourists and skiers to Tochal mountain. Within 10 minutes of driving distance from Tehran lies a ski resort. Tochal is the world's 4th highest ski resort at over 3,730 m (12,240 ft) at its highest 7th station.
            The resort was completed in 1976 shortly before the overthrow of the Shah.
    
            Here, one must first ride the eight kilometres (five mile) long gondola lift, which covers a huge vertical. The 7th station has three slopes. The resort's longest slope is the south side U shaped slope which goes from the 7th station to the 5th station. 
            The other two slopes are located on the north side of the 7th station. Here, there are two parallel chair ski lifts that go up to 3,900 m (12,795 ft) near Tochal's peak (at 4,000 m/13,125 ft), rising higher than the gondola 7th station. This altitude is higher than any of the European resorts.
    
            From the Tochal peak, one has a spectacular view of the Alborz range, including the 5,671-m (18,606 ft) high Mt. Damavand, a dormant volcano.
    
            At the bottom of the lifts in a valley behind the Tochal peak is Tochal hotel, located at 3,500 m (11,483 ft) altitude. From there a T lift takes skiers up the 3,800 m (12,500 ft) of Shahneshin peak, where the third slope of Tochal is.
