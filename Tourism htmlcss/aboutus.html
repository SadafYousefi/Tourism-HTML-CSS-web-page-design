            Tehran or Teheran, capital and largest city of Iran, and capital of Tehran province, is located in the northern part of the country. Tehran is Iran's administrative, economic, 
            and cultural centre as well as the major industrial and transport centre of the region. The city sits on the slopes of the Elburz Mountains, about 1,173m above sea level,
            on the northwestern fringes of the Kavir desert. Although the name Tehran means "warm place", the climate has marked seasonal contrasts, with short springs and autumns separating cold winters and hot, dry summers.

            Tehran is one of the largest urban centres in the Middle East. In the 1980s the metropolitan region grew rapidly, partly due to surging birthrates following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, 
            but also because of increased migration from rural to urban areas, as well as an influx of refugees from the Iran-Iraq War and fighting in Afghanistan. The density of the inner city forced many of these migrants to settle in outlying areas.

            The aim of these images acquired by the Landsat family, with a time window (before/after) of 28 years, is to show how Tehran has changed since 1988. The skyline of the city has developed with new areas constructed,
            particularly in the north west of the city and new infrastructure; such as the area where the airport is now located in the south.

            Another aim of these images is to promote the opportunity to download Landsat data through the ESA portals (or third party mission free catalogue), where images captured every day are made available in near real time to the users and the scientific community.
